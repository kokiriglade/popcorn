A very opinionated utility library for Paper. Started off as a  fork of [corn](https://github.com/broccolai/corn)'s ItemBuilder utilities. Popcorn also contains a slightly modified version of [IF](https://github.com/stefvanschie/IF) that only supports [Adventure components](https://docs.advntr.dev/text.html), and has no XML functionality.

You can find builds to put inside your server's `plugins` folder on [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/kokiriglade/popcorn).

> [!NOTE]
> Popcorn **only** ever supports the **latest** version of Minecraft, and thus Paper.

## Usage

You also need to add my Maven repository:
